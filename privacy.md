# Privacy Policy

This GPT, titled **"Canadian Defence & Dual-Use Tech Scout"**, is designed to assist with mapping Canadian defence needs to dual-use technologies, NGen-funded projects, and company capabilities.

## Data Collection

This GPT does **not** store, share, or retain any user data. All prompts and responses are ephemeral and processed within the scope of the session.

## External APIs

This GPT uses **OpenAlex** (https://api.openalex.org) to retrieve academic and scholarly content based on keywords extracted from user prompts, NGen projects, and company capabilities. These API requests are anonymous and do not transmit personal information.

No API keys or identifiable data are included in external requests.

## File Uploads

If you upload project spreadsheets, company lists, or local documents, these files are used only for the duration of your session and are not stored, shared, or retained beyond runtime.

## Email or Identification

If a `mailto` parameter is used in API queries (e.g., to OpenAlex), it is set by the developer and not collected from users.

## Security and Hosting

All GPT interactions occur within OpenAIâ€™s infrastructure, and no external logging or telemetry occurs beyond what OpenAI logs per its platform policies.
